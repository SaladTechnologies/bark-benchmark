| the traditional cyprus sandwich with halloumi  onions and tomato | Today, we're going to make the traditional cyprus sandwich with halloumi  onions and tomato. This dish will take approximately 10 minutes to prepare and cook. i first had one of these wonderful sandwiches just after i had moved to cyprus; i remember sitting in an old, rundown taverna with a chilled keo beer, whilst gazing out towards the deep blue mediterranean sea! bliss! they are usually made in long, fat finger rolls, similar to hoagies or sub rolls, but you can also make them with pitta bread or other shapes of bread rolls. halloumi is a traditional cypriot cheese, which is still made locally by lots of cypriot ladies - you often see the cheeses "hanging out to dry" in old, but hopefully clean (?) tights or stockings! halloumi is an extremely good cheese for cooking, it maintains its shape and becomes toasty and slightly salty when fried or grilled. you can buy packs of good quality cypriot halloumi cheese in most supermarkets or in a delicatessen. it can last for up to one year when bought in a vacuum-sealed pack! halloumi is the greek cypriot name for this cheese, the turkish cypriots call it hellim - it is the same cheese however, and the best cheese is made with 100% sheep’s milk. you will find these sandwiches all over cyprus in different guises, this is my favourite combination. put 2 teaspoons of the olive oil into a frying pan and cook the onions over a medium heat until soft and slightly coloured , set aside. Next,  put the remaining 1 teaspoon of oil into the frying pan and fry the halloumi slices over a medium to high heat on both sides , until golden brown and crispy around the edges. After that,  cut the roll in half , and place the halloumi slices on one half and then squeeze the lemon juice over the cooked cheese slices.

| the beefiest  juiciest  brisket what am  the smokyokie method | Today, we're going to make the beefiest  juiciest  brisket what am  the smokyokie method. This dish will take approximately 640 minutes to prepare and cook. this is actually more of a cooking method than a recipe. if all steps are followed, you will not have any problem with any of  the assertions in the name. you will get melt in your mouth brisket that is so juicy that it won't hardly accept any bbq sauce, but the flavor will be so good that you probably won't want any. if you want burnt ends, you can certainly make them, but it's doubtful that you will want to. you will need a hot charcoal fire, extra long handled tongs, a smoker large enough to accomodate the meat, a large h.d. foil pan large enough to accomodate the brisket, 8-12 hours, smoking wood (we prefer hickory or mesquite), your favorite bbq rub. select the best brisket by wiggling the brisket back and forth@ the middle of the point end. Next,  this will tell you how fatty the point cut is , and how much fat layer there is between the point and flat cut. After that,  the easier it wiggles , the better. Following that,  buy the cheapest grade you can get. Then,  we want as little marbling as possible. Subsequently,  be sure you have a whole "packer trim" brisket , and not a flat cut or point cut. Once done,  12-13# is optimum for this application. Now,  1-2 days before , rub brisket well with rub , and wrap tightly with h. Next,  d. After that,  plastic wrap , place in pan and refrigerate , or place in ice chest. Following that,  the day of the cook , start early by moving the brisket out of the fridge and packing it with black pepper. Then,  prepare your fire for the smoker , and , on a separate grill , prepare a very hot fire for searing the brisket. Subsequently,  when smoker is up to temp sear brisket thoroughly on all sides and ends as well. Once done,  we're talking so black that it looks like it's ruined , but don't worry , it's not. Now,  while it's ok to pierce the meat with a fork 2 this point , it's preferable not to. Next,  you may need help turning it w / tongs. After that,  once seared , place brisket in foil pan , fat side up , and smoke , uncovered for 2 hours. Following that,  flip brisket and smoke for 1 hour. Then,  at this point , the juices inside are under a fair amount of pressure. Subsequently,  it is important not to pierce the meat from this point until it is done. Once done,  flip brisket back to fat side up , and cover with foil. Now,  continue to smoke until internal temperature of 200 is obtained. Next,  there will come a point where the temp won't go up no matter what you do. After that,  this is normal. Following that,  resist the temptation to kick up the temp in your smoker. Then,  time remaining to achieve 200 should be 5-9 hours. Subsequently,  the reason for such a large variable is that smoker temps are not precise , and amount of "open time" will vary from cook to cook. Once done,  when 200 is obtained , remove from smoker , and allow to cool until it is safe to handle , then carefully lift brisket out and remove to a cutting board , and tent w / foil. Now,  a long spatula , or some other long support will be helpful , because it will probably try to break up on you. Next,  run pan juices through a grease separator , and freeze smoky grease in ice cube trays for baked bean seasoning. After that,  reserve pan juice to serve over brisket. Following that,  once cooled enough , separate the point from the flat. Then,  there will be a fairly easy to follow fat layer separating the two. Subsequently,  just gently slide a knife through the fat and lift and pull the point away as you cut. Once done,  if you accidentally cut into the meat , it's no tragedy , just back up a little , and go at it again. Now,  once separated , slice the point cross grain , trimming off excess fat as you go. Next,  you will likely find several slices that are too fatty to serve , or maybe some of the outer shell that's too dry to serve. After that,  reserve this meat , chop it fine , freeze , and save for baked bean seasoning. Following that,  if you look at the flat , you will see that the grain of the meat changes direction about in the middle of the cut. Then,  cut the flat in half at this point , and slice cross grain in 1 / 2#-3 / 4# slices. Subsequently,  reheat the pan juices. Once done,  there should be adequate juices to saturate the brisket. Now,  if not , supplement with store bought au jus. Next,  place sliced brisket in pan or dish with slices in the same shape as they were before slicing , and pour juices over the top. After that,  serve open faced on white bread with a little extra au jus over the top. Following that,  you should not need knives. Then,  in fact , our motto is "you don't need teef to eat our beef. Subsequently,  i know this is somewhat long and wordy , and may seem a little over simplified to the experienced pit meister , but we've tried to put it in a form that all can benefit from. Once done,  good tender , juicy smokey , brisket is to good a thing to only be enjoyed by a few , and is very hard to come by at bbq joints. | [Audio Link](https://salad-benchmark-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/recipe-audio/combined_audio_207187.mp3) |

| tried and true caramel candy | Today, we're going to make tried and true caramel candy. This dish will take approximately 20 minutes to prepare and cook. my aunt cathy has been making caramel candies for us for christmas for 25 years. i have never tasted caramels as good as hers. they are always soft and creamy with a wonderful flavor. with this recipe you can make your caramel as soft or as hard as you want to. because confection recipes are always easily affected by altitude, my aunt, who lives at a much lower elevation than me, suggested i use the drop test method instead of a candy thermometer for figuring out how hard or soft my caramel is going to turn out. i went along with her suggestion because, for one i didn't want to spring for a candy thermometer, and also because the temperature i would need to cook it to would differ for me from what she would cook it to and so she couldn't tell me what that temperature would be. (she says she cooks it to approx. 248 degrees f). so, instead of going through the trouble of trial and error, i have always used the drop test method, and it has worked for me every time. i will explain this method for those who don't know it in the directions. combine all ingredients in a heavy saucepan and cook on medium-high flame. Next,  stir consistently as the ingredients melt and combine. After that,  let mixture come to a rolling boil and continue stirring consistently. Following that,  mixture will begin to thicken more and more the longer it is allowed to boil. Then,  keep in mind that the caramel will firm up considerably when it is cooled. Subsequently,  cook to medium ball stage. Once done,  do the drop test to see how firm your caramel is. Now,  drop test: get a small bowl and fill it with ice water. Next,  set it to the side of the stove and when you think your caramel is firming up , take a spoonful and drop it in the ice water. After that,  wait about thirty seconds so it has time to cool , then take the caramel out of the ice water and squish it between your fingers. Following that,  if it isn't as firm as you want it , cook the caramel for a bit longer and then do another drop test. Then,  keep doing this until it has reached the stage you want. Subsequently,  see how easy and simple that was ?. Once done,  remove caramel from heat and let cool for a while in the pan. Now,  when it is somewhat cooled , pour it out onto a greased counter , or onto parchment paper. Next,  let cool to room temperature. After that,  use a pizza cutter to cut strip off the caramel , then cut the strip into small pieces and wrap in pieces of wax or parchment paper. Following that,  the softer the caramel , the more likely it is to stick to the wrapping. Then,  so if you like it really soft , i would suggest you use parchment paper instead of the wax. Subsequently,  the best thing about this recipe is that it tastes good no matter how hard or soft you cook it. Once done,  if you want a caramel syrup , then you boil it for a very short while. Now,  if you want a caramel toffee , the flavor will still be as wonderful. Next,  i hope you enjoy this recipe as much as i have over the years. | [Audio Link](https://salad-benchmark-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/recipe-audio/combined_audio_361331.mp3) |

After that,  melt butter in medium pot or bowl , remove from stove or microwave and stir in oats , brown sugar , flour , spices and nuts if using.

Next,  you can use other apples , granny smiths are pretty tart but that makes a nice contrast with the sweet topping. After that,  you can add a couple of teaspoons of sugar if you think they might be too tart for you or use a combo of apples - you can use your favorites , but avoid ones the go to total mush when baked. Following that,  i often stir 2-3 tsp of flour into to the apples to avoid watery juice in the bottom of the pan after baking. Then,  i like to use whole wheat pastry flour for added flavor and nutrition , or a little wheat germ in with the white flour is good too. Subsequently,  you can use this for other fruits also - sometimes i add in some frozen raspberries or sub peaches for the apples , they like blueberries and raspberries too. Once done,  peaches will probably need the extra sugar and flour added to them and a little ground ginger and / or cloves added to the topping is delish !. | [Audio Link](https://salad-benchmark-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/recipe-audio/combined_audio_319325.mp3) |

Next,  do not have the oil too hot as the almonds will then brown and their middles will still be raw. After that,  combine the remaining ingredients in a bowl to make the spice mix. Following that,  transfer the almonds to a plate using a slotted spoon and sprinkle with the spice mix.

| 15 layer russian honey cake | Today, we're going to make 15 layer russian honey cake. This dish will take approximately 75 minutes to prepare and cook. i recently tried a russian honey cake, which was one of the yummiest cakes i have ever tasted. it was so nice i decided to find the recipe and learn to make it myself. it took me about 6 months searching the net (on websites mostly in russian, which i definitely don't read or speak) translating from russian using an online translator, and trying different recipes before i found this recipe, which has produced a result at least as nice as the one i tried. i baked 2 pieces at a time on baking paper on an oven tray. each batch took just long enough to cook, that i had two more ready to swap when the first ones were done. the cream filling (and coating) is made from sour cream and sugar. the sour cream is simply whipped with the sugar until the sugar dissolves. the original recipe said to add sugar "by intuition"; i think you're supposed to keep adding more until it thickens, but the time i tried that it was too sickly sweet! i have also made the filling/coating using fresh cream - 750ml, soured with 1/2 cup lemon juice and beaten until just starting to thicken (you still use the sugar & honey). this was for a vegetarian who pointed out that the cultured sour cream i used had gelatin in it. a slightly different taste, but a very nice variation. i personally don't like walnuts all that much, so i leave them out whenever i cook this. preheat oven to 180c. Next,  beat eggs well with sugar. After that,  add baking soda and liquid honey. Following that,  melt the margarine / butter in a casserole or pot. Then,  add the mixture.

Next,  repeat with remaining dough and allow to cool before assembling. After that,  beat sour cream , sugar and honey until the sugar dissolves-the mixture will still be fairly liquid. Following that,  coat each layer with a generous layer of cream. Then,  assemble the cake , coat the sides with cream and sprinkle top and sides with crumbs and ground walnuts.

This dish will take approximately 30 minutes to prepare and cook. in south africa "fruit salad" means something a little different from most american recipes. a definitive recipe does not exist: you use what fruits you have, and in summer and fall the choice is enormous. this is a healthy, simple way to end any meal, whether humble or grand. serve with ice cream, sweet whipped cream or custard, or plain, as it comes. please read extra notes in directions. prep time and servings are a wild guess, as it will depend entirely on the fruits you choose and how much salad it will actually be: weights cannot be specified for papayas and melons (cantaloupes)! the main idea is to use at least 6 kinds of fruit. Next,  the quantity you use does not matter. After that,  the usual base fruit is papaya. Following that,  don't add anything except fruits ! halve the recipe if you like , and remember that leftovers are great for breakfast ! or process into smoothies !. Then,  a can of litchies , drained and halved , was one of the ingredients , but the zaar robot slapped me for that so i had to leave it out. Subsequently,  litchies are delicious in fruit salad. Once done,  hard fruits like apple are not really suitable. Now,  grapes can be added , or any other soft fuits. Next,  if granadillas are unobtainable , leave out , but they do lend an exotic flavour. After that,  we also use ripe guavas or canned guavas , chopped. Following that,  peel and chop the fresh fruits , but not into small pieces: they should be roughly a small bite each. Then,  if you added slightly sour fruits you will have to add some sugar. Subsequently,  drain any canned fruits , but keep the syrup. Once done,  in a large bowl gently mix the fruits. Now,  here you have to eyeball the fruit salad and guess how much juice or syrup you want to add. Next,  let's say you decide on 1 1 / 2 cups. After that,  add the vanilla to the juice / syrup. Following that,  i'm mentioning "juice" because there are fantastic pure fruit juices available , which can be used instead of the syrup from cans. Then,  beware fruits like blueberries , which will stain the entire salad. Subsequently,  you can , if you like , add a sweet citrussy liqueur like cointreau or van der hum , but usually kids love this dessert so keep that in mind. Once done,  i didn't mention oranges: unless very carefully cleaned and every scrap of white pith removed , they will eventually lend a bitter taste to the fruit salad. Now,  berries like strawberries can be used , but tend to go too soft. Next,  the salad usually stands a few hours or overnight before serving. After that,  and no , it will not last forever because the soft fruits might go mushy and / or discolour. Following that,  this is ideal for a hot summer's day , after a rich lunch. Then,  as kids we never ate it with anything , but of course it can be served with ice cream , cream or custard. | [Audio Link](https://salad-benchmark-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/recipe-audio/combined_audio_299347.mp3) |

This dish will take approximately 50 minutes to prepare and cook. this is a great cake, perfect for halloween parties, that is a take-off of the stand-by graveyard pudding. i noticed pudding is less popular than cake, and of course, cake is more suited for parties, especially those with kids. you can use your choice of cake flavor, but pay attention to the cookie crumbs you use in that case so they are compatible flavors. you also probably wouldn't want to use chocolate icing with a pumpkin cake, but if you wanted a pumpkin frosting, that would be good, or else use vanilla.you can use whipped cream to make the ghosties, but be aware that if you do this, the cake needs to remain chilled, and the whipped cream does try to sag and run after awhile (so don't do that too far in advance). the marshmallow ghosties are more durable at room temp. those are often sold near displays of halloween candy, not necessarily by the bags of marshmallows. preheat oven to 350f. Next,  mix together cake mix , water , oil , and eggs according to package directions. After that,  if your package requires different ingredients to make cake , follow those instructions instead. Following that,  grease and flour a glass 13x9-inch cake pan. Then,  if you use a dark or coated pan , do your baking at 325f. Subsequently,  pour batter into prepared pan and bake in a preheated oven for approx 35 minutes or until cake is done. Once done,  allow cake to cool in the pan. Now,  spread frosting evenly on cooled cake. Next,  sprinkle frosting with crumbled cookies. After that,  using gel frostings , write sayings on 1 / 2 of the milano cookies. Following that,  press 1 / 2 of cookie down into cake and icing to resemble a standing tombstone. Then,  arrange ghost marshmallows in a standing position on top of cake. Subsequently,  scatter candies and / or sprinkles or sugars on cake to garnish. | [Audio Link](https://salad-benchmark-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/recipe-audio/combined_audio_101397.mp3) |

Next,  if using gravy instead of stock , it needs to be quite thin. After that,  if the gravy was on the thick side even when it was hot last night at dinner , thin it down with a little chicken stock. Following that,  if you do not have enough turkey broth or leftover turkey gravy , measure what you have and add some chicken broth until you have approximately 4 total cups of liquid. Then,  when i made it last time , i had to add nearly 1 cup of chicken broth because i only had 3 cups of leftover turkey gravy. Subsequently,  it tasted just fine. Once done,  in a 10" skillet with straight sides , melt the butter over medium heat. Now,  add the scallions , peas , and carrots and cook for 2 minutes.

Now,  while you are waiting for the broth to come to a simmer , make the dumplings by whisking together the flour , baking powder , and salt. Next,  when the broth mixture comes to a simmer and you have adjusted the seasonings , add the milk and melted butter to the flour mixture and use a spoon to stir everything together until it is just combined. After that,  don't over mix or you'll toughen the dumplings. Following that,  i use two soup spoons to add the dumpling dough to the broth. Then,  i scoop up some of the dough with one spoon and push it off into the broth with the other. Subsequently,  continue adding dough as quickly as you can leaving a little room between dumplings , if possible. Once done,  it'll be a tight squeeze to get all of the dough into the broth but it'll fit. Now,  immediately cover the dumplings with a tight fitting lid and cook for 20 minutes. Next,  whatever you do , don't peek while they're cooking. After that,  the dumplings should lightly simmer while cooking. Following that,  i normally reduce the heat to someplace between medium low and medium after the first 5 minutes of cooking so the liquid does not simmer too aggressively. Then,  after 20 minutes , take the skillet off the heat and serve piping hot. Subsequently,  this is an excellent way to use up thanksgiving leftovers. Once done,  delicious and easy !. Now,  if you like a lot of soup with your dumplings , use the same amount of gravy base but halve the dumpling recipe. | [Audio Link](https://salad-benchmark-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/recipe-audio/combined_audio_399612.mp3) |

Next,  place the wings into the steamer basket , cover , reduce the heat to medium and steam for 10 minutes. After that,  remove the wings from the basket and carefully pat dry.
